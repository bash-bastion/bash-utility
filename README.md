# bash-utility

A standard utility library for Bash (previously `bash-std`)

Includes useful functions that don't belong in [bash-core](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-core)

See the [Docs](./docs/bash-utility.md) for API information

## Under Consideration

- Compatibility functions. (ex. `${param@A}` on newer bash instead of `declare -p`)

## Installation

Use [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt), a Bash package manager, to add this project as a dependency

```sh
basalt add hyperupcall/bash-std
```
